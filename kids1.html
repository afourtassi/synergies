        This is an experiment that tests aspects of human word learning. The experiment involves audio sequences. Please make sure that no music is played in the background. Put your headphones on or make sure you are in a quiet environment. <br><br> The experiment lasts approximately 3-4 minutes in total! <br><br> Warning: if you are using Internet Explorer, some aspects of the experiment might not function properly!

<!-- Include the <a href="experiment.html">JavaScript file for the experiment</a>. As written, that script immediately executes commands, so we include it here at the end of the HTML file to ensure that resources referenced by the script actually exist. For instance, one of the immediately executed commands is <code>showSlide("instructions")</code>. If we loaded experiment.js, say, in the <code>head</code> section, <code>showSlide("instructions")</code> would fail because the <code>instructions</code> slide doesn't exist yet. It is possible to load the script in <code>head</code> but you have to ensure that any immediately executed commands, if they rely on potentially uninitialized HTML elements, are _delayed_ until the page is ready, using either [window.onload][onload] or jQuery's more robust [$(document).ready()][domReady]  -->
