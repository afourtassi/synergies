    <p class="block-text"> This part of the experiment serves as a training for the task that you will perform later. </p> <p class="block-text"> An alien will be teaching an other alien the names of some objects from the planet Earth. In each trial, the alien on the left points successively to two objects (pointing will be signaled by a green light around the object), and will say their names. </p>  <p class="block-text"> He can describe these objects by different words (e.g., the word "banana" describing a banana and the word "sandwich" describing a sandwich), or by the same word (e.g., the word ''food'' describing both a banana and a sandwich).</p> <p class="block-text"> In each trial, you should press <span class="same-key">{{}}</span> if you think that the objects are being described by the <b>same</b> word, and  <span class="different-key">{{}}</span> if you think the objects are being described by 2 <b>different</b> words. </p>

  <br>

    <p class="block-text"> Now you will start the real task. Please make sure that you read and understand the following instructions:</p>  

    <p class="block-text"> Contrary to the training, the alien will NOT be speaking in English, but in an alien language. This language contains only two words: "ABA" and "ADA". </p>
        
    <p class="block-text">  As before, the alien will describe two new objects either by different words (in this case by ABA - ADA) or by a same word (ABA - ABA). </p>
        
    <p class="block-text"> One difficulty for the other alien, however, is that two instances of ABA can be pronounced slightly differently, and can sometimes be hard to distinguish from the two words ABA-ADA. </p>
    
    <p class="block-text"> <b>Another difficulty is that the objects being described will be hidden. You should help the other alien in this task based on the sounds only.</b>  </p>
    
    <p class="block-text"> In each trial, you should press <span class="same-key">{{}}</span> if you think that the hidden objects are being described by the <b>same</b> words (ABA - ABA) even when they are  pronounced slightly differently, and press <span class="different-key">{{}}</span> if you think the objects are being described by 2 <b>different</b> words (ABA - ADA). </p>
    
    <p class="block-text"> Each trial is different. Your answers for one trial do not need to be related to your other answers on subsequent trials. </p>

<!-- Include the <a href="experiment.html">JavaScript file for the experiment</a>. As written, that script immediately executes commands, so we include it here at the end of the HTML file to ensure that resources referenced by the script actually exist. For instance, one of the immediately executed commands is <code>showSlide("instructions")</code>. If we loaded experiment.js, say, in the <code>head</code> section, <code>showSlide("instructions")</code> would fail because the <code>instructions</code> slide doesn't exist yet. It is possible to load the script in <code>head</code> but you have to ensure that any immediately executed commands, if they rely on potentially uninitialized HTML elements, are _delayed_ until the page is ready, using either [window.onload][onload] or jQuery's more robust [$(document).ready()][domReady]  -->
