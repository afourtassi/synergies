        This is an experiment that tests aspects of human word learning. 
        You will be shown pairs of objects and hear their names. You should decide if the pair reprsents one word (or a variation of the same word), in which case you should press <span class="same-key">{{}}</span>,  or if the pair represents two words, <span class="different-key">{{}}</span> (detailed instructions will be provide as the experiment develops). <br><br>
		
        <b>The experiment requires that you listen carefully. Please make sure that no music is played in the background. Put your headphones on or make sure you are in a quiet environment.</b>

    <p class="block-text">You are now about to start the real experiment. As before, you will be shown two objects and hear their names. <br><br> IMPORTANT: the names you will hear are no more real english words, but artificial words. They will sound like either <b>ABA</b> or <b>ADA</b>.   As before, you should press <span class="same-key">{{}}</span> if you think the pair represents one word (that is, 2 variations of <b>ABA</b>s or 2 variations of <b>ADA</b>s), and <span class="different-key">{{}}</span> if you think the items represent two words (1 <b>ABA</b> and 1 <b>APA</b>).

    Some trials are purposefully made ambiguous. If you hesitate, go ahead and give the answer that you think is more plausible!<br><br>
        
    Note that each trial (i.e., naming of a pair of objects) is independent. Therefore, your answer on one trial is not necessarily related to you other answers  on subsequent trials.

<!-- Include the <a href="experiment.html">JavaScript file for the experiment</a>. As written, that script immediately executes commands, so we include it here at the end of the HTML file to ensure that resources referenced by the script actually exist. For instance, one of the immediately executed commands is <code>showSlide("instructions")</code>. If we loaded experiment.js, say, in the <code>head</code> section, <code>showSlide("instructions")</code> would fail because the <code>instructions</code> slide doesn't exist yet. It is possible to load the script in <code>head</code> but you have to ensure that any immediately executed commands, if they rely on potentially uninitialized HTML elements, are _delayed_ until the page is ready, using either [window.onload][onload] or jQuery's more robust [$(document).ready()][domReady]  -->
